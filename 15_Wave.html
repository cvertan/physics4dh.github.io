    <p><a class="def">Waves</a> are vibrations that have crests and troughs. The <a class="def">crests</a> are above the equilibrium position of the wave and the <a class="def">troughs</a> are below that position.</p>
    
    <p>Waves propagate in space with a definite wavelength, frequency and amplitude. </p>
    
    <p><a class="def">Wavelength</a> (<a class="value">&lambda;</a>) is the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is the distance between two consecutive identical points on the wave, such as two adjacent crests (on top), or troughs (on bottom), or corresponding zero crossings as shown in Figure. Wavelength is measured in <a class="unit">meters (m)</a> and its <a class="black" href="30_Units" target="_blank">multiples</a></p>
    
    <p><a class="def">Amplitude</a> is the height of the crest (or trough). </p>

        <p><a class="def">Frequency</a> (<a class="value">&nu;</a> or <a class="value">f</a>) is the number of wave cycles that passes through a given point in one second. The more vibrations per second, the higher frequency. The <a class="black" href="30_Units" target="_blank">unit</a> of frequency is <a class="unit">hertz (Hz)</a>. Frequency measured in hertz means how many waves pass a certain point in one second.</p>
    
    <p>Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency of the wave: waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  </p>
    
    <p>The range of all the wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a <a class="def">spectrum</a>. </p>

   <p>In physics, &lsquo;wave&rsquo; is a common term for a number of various phenomena in which <a class="black" href="20_Energy.html" target="_blank">energy</a> is transferred in different ways:
<li>In <a class="black" href="12_EM_radiation.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic waves</a>, that is <a class="black" href="1_Light.html" target="_blank">light</a>, energy is transferred through vibrations of electromagnetic field;</li> 
<li>In sound waves, energy is transferred through vibration of particles of a medium through which the sound travels;</li>
<li>In water waves, energy is transferred through the vibration of the water.</li>
  </p>
    
  <p>In physics, two waves are called <a class="def">coherent</a> if their wavelengths and waveforms are identical. Waves are <a class="def">incoherent</a> if this condition is not met. Coherence is an ideal property of waves. For example, the unique property of <a class="black" href="22_Laser.html" target="_blank">lasers</a> is to produce the coherent electromagnetic waves (<a class="black" href="1_Light.html" target="_blank">light</a>). Whereas all natural light sources as well as bulbs and LED lamps produce only incoherent light which contains many different wavelengths.</p>  
    
<p>Two waves are said to be <a class="def">in phase</a> if their crests and troughs meet at the same place at the same time, and the waves are <a class="def">out of phase</a> if the crests of one meet the troughs of another.</p>
