<p>The ink used in antiquity was most frequently black or dark brown, and was made from gum arabic, soot, gallnuts. The main <a class="def">types of ink</a> used in ancient manuscripts are: </p>
    
<p>1) <b>Iron gall ink</b> (also known as <b>oak gall ink</b> or <b>iron gall nut ink</b>) is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources. Iron (II) sulfate (also known as ‘green vitriol’ because of its colour and its glassy appearance) is the most frequently named ingredient in ink formulas. Natural vitriol consists of a mixture of metallic sulfates (iron sulfate, copper sulfate, manganese sulfate, zinc sulfate, etc.) A great variety of medieval to modern recipes name various water-soluble binders and solvents such as water, wine or vinegar that were used to extract gallic or tannic acids from gall nuts. Iron gall ink is the standard European writing and drawing ink from the 12<a class="super">th</a> to 19<a class="super">th</a> century with a history extending to the Roman empire and the Dead Sea Scrolls. </p>
    
<p>2) <b>Carbon ink</b> (also known as <b>Lampblack ink</b> or <b>soot ink</b>). Lampblack is powdery soot produced by burning oil or other combustible organic materials. Soot is basically pure carbon, sometimes containing small amounts of unburned material or other combustion products. The pigment is very stable as are all carbon blacks. There is a number of extant recipes, ranging from the late Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Carbon inks containing significant quantities of lead (Pb) were identified on a Herculaneum papyrus. </p>
    
<p>3) <b>Plant ink</b> (or <b>tannin ink</b>) are solutions of tannins extracted from various plants and are brown in colour. Inks of brown-reddish colour in Near East manuscripts have also been identified as pure vegetable extracts. </p>
    <ul class="b">
    <li>Gum arabic ink contains a natural binding substance gum arabic made from the sap of Acacia Senegal tree.  </li>
    <li>Walnut ink is an ink made from the green husk surrounding the nut of walnuts. The black walnut Juglans nigra is usually used. </li>
    <li>Vegetable-based ink. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>From the spectroscopic point of view, these types of ink have different properties that allows determination of the ink types by the spectroscopic methods. Namely, the <b>iron-gall ink</b> loses opacity being illuminated with long wavelength <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms"> light</a> (750–1000 nm) and becomes transparent at 1200 nm; <b>plant ink</b> is transparent already at &#8275; 700 nm; the color of <b>soot ink/carbon ink</b> is independent of the <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/15_Wave.html" target="frameterms">wavelength</a> between 300–1700 nm. </p>
    
    <p>Thus, illuminating the sample, for example, at 940 nm (which is <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/10_infrared%20light.html" target="frameterms">NIR region</a> of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/13_EM_spectrum.html" target="frameterms">electromagnetic spectrum</a>), we can determine the ink typology by observing the changes in the opacity of the ink. Here, carbon-based inks show no change in their opacity when illuminated, while the opacity of iron-gall inks changes considerably, and plant inks become transparent. Taked pictures of illuminated sample are for further analysis. </p>
    
     <p>This principle is underlying infrared photography (<a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/M43_Spectral_imaging.html" target="_blank">infrared imaging</a>) which is traditionally used for investigation of the ink typology. </p>
