    <p><a class="def">Microwaves</a> are <a class="black" href="12_EM_radiation.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic radiation</a> which has a <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">wavelength</a> <a class="def">between 1 mm and 1 m</a>, that is longer than one of <a class="black" href="18_visible_light.html" target="_blank">visible light</a>.  </p>
    
<p>As far as the atmosphere of the Earth is transparent for electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from a few millimeters to about twenty meters, microwaves can travel through the air and can be used as information signals in cellular telephony, radiolocation systems (radars) and astronomy. Over the world, mobile phones are operating at <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">frequencies</a> between 450 and 2700 <a class="black" href="30_Units.html" target="_blank">MHz</a> [<a class="ref" href=bibliography.html#who>who</a>]. Radars serve to determine the location of the object relative to the site. For military use, radars detect and track spacecraft, aircraft, ballistic missiles, ships and vehicles. For weather forecast service, radars provide weather formation mapping. Also, astronomers use it to learn about the structure of nearby galaxies.  
In daily life, the microwave radiation helps us to cook.
