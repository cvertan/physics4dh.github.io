    <p>Generally, <a class="def">radiation</a> is the flow of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/20_Energy.html" target="frameterms">energy</a>, emitted in the form of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/15_Wave.html" target="frameterms">waves</a> or <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">particles</a> from a source. Radiation propagates through space or a medium until it is <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/7_Absorption.html" target="frameterms">absorbed</a> by other objects. More simply, radiation is energy that travels and spreads out as it goes.  </p>
    <p>The most known source of radiation is the Sun. Part of solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth atmosphere, another part is absorbed by our skin getting warm and tanned, other part of solar radiation lets our eyes see all objects around. So, on a sunny day, we get heat and light energy from the Sun due to its radiation. </p>
        
    <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/15_Wave.html" target="frameterms">wave</a>
    
<p>There are two main categories of radiation: <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/12_EM_radiation.html" target="frameterms">electromagnetic</a> and particulate:</p>
<p>&bull; <a class="def">electromagnetic radiation</a> refers to the emission of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/2_Photon.html" target="frameterms">photons</a>. Photons are constantly in motion at a speed of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms">light</a>, they have energy but no mass or electrical charge. </p>
<p>&bull; <a class="def">particulate radiation</a> refers to the emission of particles from radioactive materials or nuclear reactions. Particles have energy and mass, and may or may not have an electric charge. There are several types of particulate radiation:</p>
   
<ol class="c"> 
<li><b>Neutrons (n)</b> are uncharged particles found in the nucleus of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">atoms</a>. They are emitted during certain types of nuclear reactions and radioactive decay. Neutrons have a high penetrating ability and can travel long distances through materials, making them difficult to shield. They can cause nuclear reactions and induce radioactivity in materials they interact with. </li>
    <li><b>Protons (p)</b> are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of atoms. They can be emitted during certain nuclear reactions or as a result of particle accelerators. Protons have a relatively large mass and a positive charge. Their behavior and interaction with matter depend on their energy. </li>
    
   <li><b>Alpha particles (&alpha;)</b> are helium nuclei consisting of two protons and two neutrons. They have a positive charge and are relatively large and heavy. Due to their size and charge, alpha particles can be stopped by a few centimeters of air or a sheet of paper.  </li>
<li><b>Beta particles (&beta;)</b> are high-energy electrons (&beta;-) or positrons (&beta;+) emitted during the radioactive decay of radioactive materials. Beta particles have a negative charge (&beta;-) or positive charge (Î²+) and are much smaller and lighter than &alpha;-particles. They can penetrate further requiring thicker shielding such as aluminum or plastic to stop them.</li>
