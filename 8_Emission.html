    <p>Under normal conditions (in the absence of external influences) an <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">electron</a> can stay only for a short period in an <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/6_Energy%20levels.html" target="frameterms">excited state</a> and will always tend to move to the <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/6_Energy%20levels.html" target="frameterms">ground</a> or lower levels, what is determined by the laws of physics. The time an electron “lives” in excited level is called <a class="def">lifetime</a> and is very small, of the range of 10<sup>-3</sup>-10<sup>-9</sup> s. After this time, the electron falls back to the ground state by releasing <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/20_Energy.html" target="frameterms">energy</a> in the form of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/2_Photon.html" target="frameterms">photons</a> or heat. The electrons transition from higher energy state to lower energy state occurs naturally or spontaneously. That is why, the process in which an electron falls from an excited energy state to a lower energy state releasing energy in the form of photon is called <a class="def">spontaneous emission of light</a>.</p>
        
     <p>Movie shows the process of the spontaneous emission: the transition of the electron from the higher energy level of energy <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> to the lower energy level of energy <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> followed by releasing of the photon. The energy of the released photon is equal to the energy difference between two energy levels: </p>
            
    <a class="eq" align="center">
    <i>h</i>&nu; = &Delta;<i>E</i> = <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> </a>
        
    <p>Spontaneous emission of a photon is ultimately responsible for most of the light we see all around us. This is the way how the <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms">light</a> is producing.</p>

    <p>In spontaneous emission, the electrons in the excited state will remain there until its lifetime is over. Alternatively, the excited electrons can be forcefully returned to ground state before completion of their lifetime. This is possible when incident photon interacts with the excited electron in such way that forces it to return to the ground state. While falling to the ground state, the electron releases energy in the form of photon. The process by which incident photon interacts with the excited electron and forces it to return to the ground state resulting in emission of the new photon is called <a class="def">stimulated emission of light</a>. </p>
    
    <p>Unlike the spontaneous emission, the stimulated emission is not a natural process it is an artificial process. Unlike the photon produced in spontaneous emission process, the photon produced in stimulated emission process has special properties: its <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/3_Photon%20energy.html" target="frameterms">energy</a>, <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/15_Wave.html" target="frameterms">frequency</a>, phase and direction of travel are all identical to the incident photon. Thus, stimulated emission process results in appearance of two identical photons. This phenomenon has made possible the development of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/22_Laser.html" target="frameterms">lasers</a>. </p>
