<p>3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect data on the form and texture of surfaces and objects. The collected data are then used to construct digital 3D model of the object. </p>
        
<p>The 3D scanning process typically involves taking multiple measurements (<a target="_blank" class="ref" href="M41_3D_Laser_Scanning.html">laser</a> and <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="M41_3D_Structured_Light.html">structured light</a> scanning) or images (<a target="_blank" class="ref" href="M41_3D_Photo.html">photogrammetry</a>) of an object or scene from different angles and perspectives. These measurements or images are then combined and processed to create a digital 3D model that accurately represents the shape and appearance of the original object or environment.</p>

<p>The acquisition of 3D coordinates of points on the object surface is performing without any contact, at a high rate (hundreds or thousands of points per second) achieving the results in (near) real time. 3D Three dimensional representation is due to coordinate values relative to the X, Y and Z axes of a Cartesian system of each point on the studied surface. The collected data are used to construct digital 3D models of the object – a 'geometric mesh’ composed of vertices, edges and flat planes. The 3D model can be used for study or outputted as a physical object via 3D printing.</p>
   
<p>The main 3D scanning techniques used today are <a class="ref" href="M41_3D_Laser_Scanning.html">Laser scanning</a>, <a class="ref" href="M41_3D_Structured_Light.html">Structured light projection</a> and <a class="ref" href="M41_3D_Photo.html">Photogrammetry</a>. </p>
        
<p><a class="def">3D Laser scanning</a> is an automatic process of collecting data on the shape of a real-world object using <a target="frameterms" class="ref" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/22_Laser.html">laser</a> light.   </p>
 <p><a class="def">Structured light scanning</a> is a type of 3D scanning technology that use projected patterns of light to capture the shape and geometry of an object or environment. </p>
 <p><a class="def">Photogrammetry</a> is a method of extracting 3D information from 2D images using feature mapping software and a range of algorithms. </p>
        
<p>3D scanning technique is usually classified into 2 categories by range (the maximum distance at which it can accurately capture data):</p>
    
    <p><b>Long-medium range 3D scanning</b> is used to record the general shape of large objects and surfaces with the aim of getting accurate metrological information. The working distance is up to 2 km. </p>
        
    <p><b>Close range 3D scanning</b> are used to record the shape and surface of objects in great detail. For ex., Recording shape and surface of sculptures and complex forms. The working distance is falling between 8 cm and 1 m. The output can be both for study using screen-based applications or to be re-materialised for a range of purposes including tactile objects for the blind and partially sighted, facsimile production and exhibition display. </p>

   <p class="thema">Research tasks &amp; applications</p> 
<p>The main task of 3D scanning is a <b>high-resolution 3D recording</b> of the surfaces and forms of sites and artifacts and archiving them in raw formats, so the data can continue to be re-processed as technology advances. By creating a 3D model of an object in this way, 3D scanning serves to <b>digital preservation</b>.</p>
        
<p>Offering digital preservation of the obects and sites, 3D scanning has a wide range of <b>applications</b> in various industries, including manufacturing, architecture, archaeology, entertainment, healthcare, engineering, quality control, product design, virtual reality and many other.</p>
        
 <p>Over recent years, 3D scanning has become part of a non-contact approach to the <b>documentation of cultural heritage and its long term preservation</b>. For ex.,  documentations of indoor and outdoor environments i.e. monuments, buildings, archeological sites, cathedrals (exterior and interior) etc. Knowledge of the tangible components (position, size, shape) and intangible components (identity, habits) of an historic building, sites or artifacts makes a big contribution to the conservation of cultural heritage. </p>

</div>  
        
<p>In cultural heritage documentation, long-medium range scanners are normally used in combination with close-range 3D scanners to generate models with both global metrological accuracy and high resolution surface detail. Close range scanning is slower than long-medium range scanning or photogrammetry.</p>

<p>Types of 3D scanners by mobility:</p> 
    <ul class="b">
    <li><b>Terrestrial (Tripod-mounted) scanner</b> is a type of 3D laser scanner that is used to capture images from a fixed position on the ground (mounted on a tripod or other stable platform). Terrestrial scanners are commonly used for stationary scanning applications that require accurate measurements of large structures or areas. They may use a rotating mirror or other mechanism to capture data from different angles and typically capture larger volumes of data more quickly than handheld scanners.</li>
    <li><b>Handheld 3D scanners</b> are designed to be portable and operated by hand, making them ideal for capturing data in hard-to-reach areas. Handheld scanners typically use a combination of cameras and <a target="frameterms" class="ref" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/22_Laser.html">lasers</a> to capture 3D data, and they may require multiple scans to capture a complete model.</li>
    <li><b>Mobile 3D scanners</b> are mounted on a vehicle or other mobile platform, such as a drone or robot, allowing them to capture 3D data while in motion. Mobile scanners may be used for mapping and surveying applications, as well as for inspecting large structures or environments, such as bridges or industrial facilities.</li>
