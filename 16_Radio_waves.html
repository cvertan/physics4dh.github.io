    <p> <a class="def">Radio waves</a> are <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic radiation</a> which has the lowest <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">frequency</a> and the longest <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">wavelength</a> in <a class="black" href="13_EM_spectrum.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. This electromagnetic radiation has frequencies of <a class="def">300 MHz</a> and below. These correspond to wavelengths raging approximately <a class="def">from 1 to thousands of meters</a>. We can imagine the size of various radio waves as big as a bottle, or car, or ship, or even mountain.  </p>
    
<p>They are used to transport information through the atmosphere without wires. They are used in radio and television, navigation and air-traffic control, and even remote-controlled toys. Radio-wave communications signals travel through the air in a straight line, reflect off of clouds or layers of the ionosphere, or are relayed by satellites in space. In that way radio waves carry signals to our radio and TV. Astronomers use radio telescopes to receive radio waves emitted by stars, galaxies and nebulas to study the universe.
