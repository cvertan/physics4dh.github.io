<p>This is a platform for the integration, structuring, and explanation of the theoretical background and potentials of research methods from physics that are relevant to Digital Humanities (DH) approaches. </p>
    <p>Due to the complex theoretical background, these methods and tools are typically used by end users as black boxes and the replicability of experiments is very low. We believe that created platform will help to bridge this lack of explanation having an impact on result reproducibility and overall research sustainability. </p>
    <p>You will find materials explaining the principles underlying the most common <b>non-destructive or minimally invasive techniques of research and preservation of cultural heritage objects</b>. </p>
    <p>The presentation of each method is structured along the following issues: </p>
    <ol class="custom-counter">
  <li> general overview of the method;</li>
  <li> description of the underlying principle;</li>
  <li> tasks for which the method is used;</li>
  <li> the necessary instruments;</li>
  <li> real case studies of the method's application in DH projects together with the corresponding references to scientific literature.</li>
</ol>
      
    <p>A <b>glossary/thesaurus</b> of specialized terms is connected with the descriptions of the methods through hyperlinks. The thesaurus entries are clustered alphabetically. </p>
    <p>The project is funded by Volkswagenstiftung. </p>
