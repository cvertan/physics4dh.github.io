    <p>Every object in the universe is made up of atoms. <a class="def">Atoms</a> are the basic units of matter, a particle of a substance, a smallest carrier of substance properties. </p> 
        <p>For now, 118 types of different atoms are known. Accordingly, there are 118 different chemical elements making our universe. All they are represented in <a href="https://ptable.com/#Properties" target="_blank">Periodic Table</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Size of atoms is extremely small, it ranges between 30 and 300 pm (trillionths of a meter), or between 0.3 and 3 &aring;ngstr&ouml;ms (<a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/30_Units.html" target="frameterms">1 &Aring; = 100 pm</a>). About 5 million hydrogen atoms could fit into a pin head. </p>
    
    <p><a class="def">Each atom consists of atomic nucleus and a set of electrons orbiting the nucleus</a>. </p>
        
        <p><a class="def">Electron</a> is a <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">particle</a>, which has negative electric charge. This charge is elementary, i.e. the smallest in the universe. </p>

    <p><a class="def">Nucleus</a> of atom is 10,000 times smaller than the atom. If an atom was of the size of Wembley Stadium, then the nucleus would be of the size of a garden pea. Charge of the nucleus is positive. Electrons always orbit the nucleus because of the electrostatic force of attraction present between them. The atom nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. </p>
    
    <p><a class="def">Proton</a> is a <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">particle</a>, which has elementary positive electric charge.</p>
    <p><a class="def">Neutron</a> is a <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">particle</a>, which has no charge. Protons and neutrons have the same mass; electrons have about 2,000 times less mass than protons and neutrons.  </p>
    
    
    <p>Chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. For example, any atom that contains 20 protons is calcium, and any atom that contains 79 protons is gold. Number of chemical element in Periodic Table corresponds to the number of protons in the its atomic nucleus. Every atom of a certain chemical element is the same. For example, all hydrogen atoms in the universe are the same. The hydrogen in our body is exactly the same as the hydrogen in the Sun. </p>
