    <p><a class="def">Color</a> of the <a class="black" href="1_Light.html" target="_blank">light</a> which perceived by the human eye is determined by value of its <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">wavelengths</a>. Different colors of light have different wavelengths. For example, the wavelengths of the blue light are ranging from 450 to 495 nm, the wavelengths of the green light are ranging from 495 to 570 nm, the wavelengths of the red light  are ranging from 620 to 750 nm. </p>
    
     <p>Light from Sun, candle or common lightbulb in our room contains all colors of rainbow. Combination of all colors makes white light, which corresponds to complete visible range in the <a class="black" href="13_EM_spectrum.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic spectrum</a> (from 380 nm to 750 nm). Combining primary colors of light like red, blue, and green creates secondary colors: yellow, cyan, and magenta. All other colors can be broken down into different combinations of the three primary colors. </p>

     <p>We see objects because they reflect (or bounce) light into our eyes. The color we see is a result of back <a class="black" href="23_Reflection.html" target="_blank">reflection</a> of light of certain wavelength from the object to our eyes. </p>
    
      <p> For example, a red flower looks red because it reflects red light and absorbs light of the other colors. A yellow banana reflects red and green light, and absorbs the rest. </p>
    
    <p>When a red flower is illuminated with pure-blue light, it no longer looks red, because there is no red light to reflect from the object. It absorbs the blue light and appears to be black. </p>
    
    <p>A white object reflects all colors of <a class="black" href="18_visible_light.html" target="_blank">visible light</a>, and a black object absorbs all colors of visible light. </p>
