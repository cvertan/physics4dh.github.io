    <p>In an <a class="black" href="5_Atom.html" target="_blank">atom</a>, <a class="black" href="5_Atom.html" target="_blank">electrons</a> can jump between the <a class="black" href="6_Energy%20levels.html" target="_blank">energy levels</a>: a) from lower energy level to the higher energy level, and b) from higher energy level to the lower energy level. </p>
        
     <p> The first case is when an electron in the lower energy level is obtaining some extra <a class="black" href="20_Energy.html" target="_blank">energy</a> that matches the energy difference between higher energy level and the lower energy level. Getting sufficient energy, electron jumps to the higher energy level and this phenomenon is called an <a class="def">absorption</a>. This extra energy can be supplied from various types of energy sources such as heat or <a class="black" href="1_Light.html" target="_blank">light</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The electron can receive an extra energy absorbing a light <a class="black" href="2_Photon.html" target="_blank">photon</a> of the sufficient energy. Movie shows a process of absorption of the photon followed by the transition of the electron from the lower energy level to the higher energy level. The energy of absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference &Delta;<i>E</i> between the upper <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> and lower <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> energy levels of the electron: </p>
    
    <a class="eq" align="center">
        &Delta;<i>E</i>=<i>E<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> </a>
    
    
    <p> The process of absorbing energy in the form of photon is called <a class="def">absorption of light</a>. Absorption of light occurs only if the energy of photon exactly matches the difference in energy between the two electron energy states.</p>
