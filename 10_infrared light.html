    <p>This <a class="black" href="25_radiation.html" target="_blank">radiation</a> is not perceived by the human eye, but we experience it every day touching warm objects. Our cap of coffee, candle, cat or dog are emitting infrared light which we feel as heat.  </p>
    
    <p>Thermal vision goggles or cameras allow to see objects in the dark. Night vision goggles and thermal cameras pick up the infrared light emitted by our skin and heated objects, allowing creation of image of the objects (so called thermal imaging). Warm-blooded animals can also be monitored with thermal imaging during clinical diagnostics as well. </p>
    
    <p>Infrared is also used for some short range ‘line of sight’ communication, such as TV remote controls. In astronomy, infrared light is employed for mapping the dust between stars. </p>
