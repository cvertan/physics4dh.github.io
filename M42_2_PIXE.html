<p>Particle-induced X-ray emission or proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental content of a substance from the <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/21_X-ray.html" target="frameterms">X-ray</a> <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/8_Emission.html" target="frameterms">emission</a> caused by the irradiation of the substance with high-energy charged <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">particles</a> (such as protons or ions). The elements are identified according to the X-ray energy lines that are characteristic of each element. The X-ray intensities at specific energies are used to quantify each element in the sample under analysis. </p>

    <p>PIXE is a powerful analytical technique that can provide valuable information about the <b>elemental composition</b> of a sample.
technique, called <b>microPIXE</b> using tightly focused beams (down to 1 μm) an be used to determine the <b>distribution of trace elements</b> in a wide range of samples.
PIXE is used in a variety of applications, including environmental analysis, materials science, and cultural heritage preservation helping answer questions of provenance, dating and authenticity.

   <p class="thema">Principle</p> 
<p>Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) is an analytical technique that involves bombarding a sample with high-energy charged <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">particles</a>, such as protons or ions. The principle behind PIXE is that when these particles interact with the <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">atoms</a> in the sample, they can cause the ejection of inner-shell <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/14_Particle.html" target="frameterms">electrons</a>. This creates vacancies that are subsequently filled by outer-shell electrons, resulting in the emission of characteristic <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/21_X-ray.html" target="frameterms">X-rays</a> that can be detected and analyzed to determine the elemental composition of the sample. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
<p>PIXE is primarily used for the analysis of light elements (with atomic number Z &le; 30), as the X-rays emitted by these elements are easily detectable and have well-defined <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/20_Energy.html" target="frameterms">energies</a>. It provides quantitative elemental analysis with high sensitivity and can be used on a wide range of sample types, including biological samples, environmental samples, and cultural heritage materials. </p>

   <p class="thema">Equipment</p> 
<p>The PIXE method requires specialized equipment to generate and detect the X-rays emitted by the sample material. The equipment used in PIXE is complex and expensive, and typically requires specialized training to operate. Detailed description of the instrumentation used for PIXE method is given in [<a class="ref" href=bibliography.html#PIXE_RBS_2000>PIXE_RBS_2000</a>]. </p>
<p>The key components of a PIXE system include: </p>
        
<ul class="b">
    <li><b>Particle accelerator</b>, such as a <a class="black" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unydXO6Yenw">cyclotron</a> or a <a class="black" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20lKZB5BR0">Van de Graaff accelerator</a>, is used to generate a beam of high-energy protons or alpha particles. To measure the beam current of the charged particles used for bombardment, a Faraday cup is used. A Faraday cup is a metal (conductive) cup designed to catch charged particles in vacuum. The resulting current can be measured and used to determine the number of ions or electrons hitting the cup.</li>
    <li><b>Sample chamber (or target chamber)</b> is where the sample is placed and bombarded with the high-energy particles.</li>
    <li><b>X-ray detector</b> is used to measure the energy and intensity of the X-rays emitted by the sample. The most commonly used detectors for PIXE are solid-state detectors, such as silicon or germanium detectors, which have high energy resolution.</li>
    <li><b>Data acquisition system</b> is used to collect and process the data from the X-ray detector. This system typically includes analog-to-digital converters, signal amplifiers, and software for data analysis.</li>
    <li><b>Data analysis software</b> is used for extraction of X ray peak areas from the PIXE spectrum and their correlation to the concentration of particular element, form the basis of quantitative PIXE analysis. A large variety of PIXE software packages exist today, with most of them available to calculate both X ray peak areas (intensities) and respective elemental concentrations.</li>
