    <p>Light is a part of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to human eye. </p>
    <p>Quantum theory describes light as a flow of discrete packets of energy, called photons. Photon represents the smallest unit (a quantum) of light. A single photon of light is too dim for a human being to see. It takes a few photons for us to be perceived as light. Frogs, however, are able to see a single photon.</p>
    <p>In physics, the term "light" refers more broadly to any type of electromagnetic radiation, whether visible or not. For part of electromagnetic radiation perceived by the human eye, they commonly use term “visible light”.</p>
    <p>In the 19<a class ="super">th</a> century, light was described by James Maxwell in terms of electromagnetic waves, but in 20<a class ="super">th</a> century, physicists showed that it exhibits properties of particles as well. So, all behavior of light can be explained by combining the two models: light behaves like particles and light behaves like waves. Dual nature of light is revealed only by quantum mechanics in wave-particle duality concept.</p>
    <p>Light travels through empty space at a speed of about 300,000 km/s. </p>
