    <p>Light is a part of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to human eye. </p>
    <p>We experience light from different natural and artificial sources – Sun, stars, flame, light bulb or phone screen. </p>
    <p>Light spreads out as a flow (or stream) of photons. Photon represents the smallest unit (a quantum) of light. Photons are massless, the theoretical value of its mass is equal to zero. Photons always move in at the speed of light – about 300,000 km/s.  </p>
    <p> In physics, the term "light" refers more broadly to any type of electromagnetic radiation, whether visible or not. For part of electromagnetic radiation perceived by the human eye, they commonly use term “visible light”.</p>
