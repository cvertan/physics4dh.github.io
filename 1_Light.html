    <p><a class="def">Light</a> is a part of <a class="black" href="12_EM_radiation.html" target="_blank">electromagnetic radiation</a>
      that is visible to human eye. </p>
    <p>Quantum theory describes light as a flow of discrete packets of <a class="black" href="20_Energy.html" target="_blank">energy</a>, called <a class="def">photons</a>. <a class="black" href="2_Photon.html" target="_blank">Photon</a> represents the smallest unit (a <a class="black" href="2_Photon.html" target="_blank">quantum</a>) of light. A single photon of light is too dim for a human being to see. It takes a few photons for us to be perceived as light. Frogs, however, are able to see a single photon.</p>

<p>In physics, the term "light" refers more broadly to any type of electromagnetic radiation, whether visible or not. For part of electromagnetic radiation perceived by the human eye, they commonly use term “<a class="black" href="18_visible_light.html" target="_blank">visible light</a>”.</p>
    
    <p>In the 19<a class ="super">th</a> century, light was described by James Maxwell in terms of electromagnetic <a class="black" href="15_Wave.html" target="_blank">waves</a>, but in 20<a class ="super">th</a> century, physicists showed that it exhibits properties of <a class="black" href="14_Particle.html" target="_blank">particles</a> as well. So, all behavior of light can be explained by combining the two models: light behaves like particles and light behaves like waves. Dual nature of light is revealed only by quantum mechanics in <a class="black" href="2_Photon.html" target="_blank">wave-particle duality</a> concept.</p>
    <p>Light travels through empty space at a speed of about <a class="def">300,000 km/s</a>.</p>
