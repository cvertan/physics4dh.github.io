<p><a class="def">Electromagnetic radiation</a> is a kind of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/
    1">radiation</a> released by an <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms">light</a>atom in the form of <a class="def">electromagnetic waves</a>. It consists of oscillating <b>electric and magnetic fields</b> that are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms">light</a>wave propagation. In electromagnetic radiation, the electric field and magnetic field are linked and support each other's existence. When an electric field changes, it induces a magnetic field, and when a magnetic field changes, it induces an electric field. This interplay between the electric and magnetic fields allows the <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms">light</a>energy to propagate through space as an electromagnetic wave. The <b>electric field</b> is responsible for exerting forces on electrically charged <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/1_Light.html" target="frameterms">light</a>particles, while the <b>magnetic field</b> interacts with moving charges.</p>

<p>It is important, that electromagnetic radiation means no substance to be transferred in space, there is just a perturbation/fluctuation of space resulting in the transfer of energy.</p>
    
<p>The energy carried by electromagnetic radiation is spread over a range of wavelengths, forming the electromagnetic spectrum. This spectrum includes various types of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of wave has a unique wavelength, frequency, and energy.</p>
              
<p>The visible light that comes from a lamp in your house and the radio waves that come from a radio station are two types of electromagnetic radiation. The visible light is electromagnetic radiation perceived by the human eye.  </p>

<p>Electromagnetic radiation always propagates in vacuum at the speed having constant value that is exactly equal to 299,792,458 meters per second (approximately <a class="def">300,000</a> kilometers per second. According to the special theory, it is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy can travel through space. This value is called “<a class="def">speed of light</a>”, as far as physicists use the term "light" to any type of electromagnetic radiation, whether perceived by the human eye or not. Light takes about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth. In a vacuum, nothing can travel faster.</p>
    
<p> The smallest amount of energy that can be emitted or absorbed by atom in the form of electromagnetic radiation is called <a class="def">photon</a>, that can be considered as a wave and as a particle. Photon contains neither mass nor charge.</p>
