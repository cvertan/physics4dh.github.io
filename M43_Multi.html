 <p>Spectral imaging is a technique that combines <b>spectroscopy</b> and <b>imaging</b> to create a spectral map of a sample, which can provide information about the chemical and physical properties of the sample. It is a type of imaging that captures data from many different <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="15_Wave.html">wavelengths </a> of <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="1_Light.html">light</a> and gives a detailed view of an object or site.</p>
        
<p>Spectral imaging can be considered as a special case of spectroscopy (“<b>imaging spectroscopy</b>”) or a special case of imaging (“<b>spectral imaging</b>”). Current practice is to use adjectives such as “<b>multi-</b>” and “<b>hyper-</b>” added to “spectral imaging” in order to characterize the number of used light wavelengths, that can vary from 10 to 2000 in one investigation.</p>

<p>Spectral imaging is currently much used technique for a comprehensive examination of an object or material, providing insights into its composition, structure and condition, in different fields, such as chemistry, geology, medicine, food, agriculture, remote sensing and materials science. It is also an effective tool in conservation science allowing recording, analysis and protection of artifacts. It is becoming increasingly popular for use in cultural heritage sites around the world. </p>
<p>The tasks of multispectral imaging in applications for cultural heritage include: </p>
<ul class="b">
    <li>to recover erased text in palimpsests; </li>
    <li>to restore damaged manuscripts;</li>
    <li>to characterize the paper components and their degradation or damage;</li>
    <li>to document and analyze the various layers of a cultural site, such as paint layers on a wall or the layers of a burial mound;</li>
    <li>to identify materials;</li>
    <li>to detect anomalies. </li>

<p>The equipment used in spectral imaging can vary depending on the specific application, but the key components are the light source, spectrometer, camera and data analysis software. The equipment used in spectral imaging typically includes: </p>  
 <ol class="c">
    <li><b>Light source</b> is used to illuminate the sample. Depending on the type of sample and the application, different types of light sources may be used, such as white light, filtered light or <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="22_Laser.html">laser light </a>. </li>
    <li><b>Spectrometer</b> is used to separate the light from the sample into its component wavelengths (or frequencies). The most commonly used types of <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="27_Spectrometer.html">spectrometers</a> for spectral imaging are dispersive spectrometers and Fourier transform spectrometers.</li>
    <li><b>Imaging system (camera or microscope)</b> is used to capture the spectral image of the sample. The imaging system typically includes a sensor or detector, which records the intensity of the <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="1_Light.html">light</a> at each <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="15_Wave.html">wavelength</a> or <a target="_blank" class="ref" href="15_Wave.html">frequency</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Data analysis software</b> can be used to create spectral maps, which show the distribution of different chemical or physical properties across the sample. Spectral imaging generates large amounts of data, and specialized software is required to analyze and interpret the data. </li>

    <td><p>This study will focus on the response of iron gall ink to multispectral illumination. The goal was to recover the erased text and make it legible for a scholar to read. </p>
<p>The multispectral imaging system developed by <a class="ref" target="_blank" href="https://mega-vision.com/products/ev-spectral-imaging-system/">MegaVision</a> (‘Archival and Cultural Heritage Imaging’) was used. Several LEDs of different wavelengths have turned on at the same time to generate white light for positioning the manuscript. During image capture, LEDs are turned on individually to illuminate the manuscript with only one wavelength of light, at a time. The camera has a 50 mega-pixel, panchromatic sensor that records the response of the manuscript leaf to each wavelength of light. Three types of optical images were captured: 1) simple reflectance of the light from the parchment surface; 2) fluorescence images under ultraviolet light illumination; 3) images taken of light that is transmitted through the parchment leaf. The leaf is illuminated from a light sheet that sits below the leaf. </p>

    <td><p>The goal was to identify the compositions, recover the lost writings in manuscripts and create a publishable set of images that enhance the original notation. The task is made more difficult not only by the scraped content, but also because of the fact that by the end of the 15th century the manuscript had been completely disassembled, therefore the compositions appear in the wrong order today.</p>
<p>Manuscripts do not only include new readings for compositions known from other contemporary manuscripts, but also contains completely unknown compositions by Italian composers from the beginning of the 15th century. </p>
<p>The <a class="ref" target="_blank" href="https://mega-vision.com/products/ev-spectral-imaging-system/">EV&trade; multi-spectral imaging system</a> was used for imaging in this study employs a 50-megapixel monochromatic camera, 13 different wavelengths between 365 and 1050 nm, five filters and two raking lights in blue and infrared. The system is portable, so it was possible to transport it to the Archivio del Capitolo di San Lorenzo to image on site in one of the archive’s rooms prepared to accommodate all the equipment. This included a cradle specifically designed to hold delicate manuscripts. Since it was not possible to remove folios from the binding and produce images of each page individually, an acrylic plate was placed over each folio to keep it standing upright and to keep the book from closing. </p>
<p>Under illumination of the palimpsest with different light wavelengths, pictures of three types were taken by means of the camera using the optic filters: 
1)	raking-light images; 
2)	reflectance images; 
3)	fluorescence images.
 </p>
<p>The use of raking lights allows the capture of topographical and texture information relating to the folio. Reflectance and fluorescence images allow to ‘show through’ over- and underwriting for the reader. </p>
<p>A total of 24 different reflectance and fluorescence images were taken and included in the processing work using the statistical methods of principal component analysis (PCA) and occasionally independent component analysis (ICA) implemented in the Excelis ENVI software package. </p>
