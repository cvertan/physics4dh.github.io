<p><a class="def">Particle</a> is a small localized object to which can be ascribed several physical properties, such as volume and mass. Particle can be visualized as a ball having some mass, physical dimensions and occupying some volume. Unlike <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/15_Wave.html" target="frameterms">waves</a> , particles are localized in space. </p>

<p>In physics, a particle is a fundamental unit of matter or <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/20_Energy.html" target="frameterms">energy</a>. It is a term used to describe the smallest, indivisible entities that make up the physical world. Particles can be either elementary particles or composite particles.</p>

<p><b>Elementary particles</b> are the basic building blocks of matter and are not composed of smaller particles. They are considered fundamental because they do not have any known substructure. Elementary particles include <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">electrons</a> and neutrinos, <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/2_Photon.html" target="frameterms">photons</a>, quarks, and gauge bosons. </p>

<p><b>Composite particles</b> are made up of combinations of elementary particles. They are formed when elementary particles bind together through various forces. Examples of composite particles include <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">protons</a> and <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">neutrons</a>, which are composed of quarks bound together by the strong <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/5_Atom.html" target="frameterms">nuclear</a> force. Composite particles can have properties and behaviors that differ from their constituent particles.</p>

    <p> Physicists distinguish particles of great variety in size: <a class="def">subatomic</a> particles (10<a class ="super">-18</a>-10<a class ="super">-16</a> m) like the electron, <a class="def">microscopic</a> particles (10<a class ="super">-10</a>-10<a class ="super">-8</a> m) like atoms, and <a class="def">macroscopic</a> particles (10<a class ="super">-6</a>-10<a class ="super">-4</a> m) like powders. </p>
        
<p>Particles can have mass, electric charge and other properties that determine their behavior and interactions with other particles. They can also exhibit <a class="black" href="https://cvertan.github.io/physics4dh.github.io/2_Photon.html" target="frameterms">wave-particle duality</a>, meaning they can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like characteristics under certain conditions.
